    <img src="asset/structure.jpg" width="500" height="300">
    <p><i> Tags are very important . We first write an open tag then write content & then write closing tag. Some tags
            are self closing. Structural markup includes headings & structure of the website.HTML has 6 level of
            headings. The first is for main heading & the remaining is for sub headings.
            The bold element also represents a section of text that would be presented in a visually different way (for
            example key words in a paragraph) although the use ofthe element does not imply
            any additional meaning.
            The italic element also representsa section of text that would besaid in a different way fromsurrounding
            content â€” such astechnical terms, names of shipsforeign words, thoughts, or other terms that would usually
            be italicized.The super script element is used to write something in superscript like some maths formulas &
            some dates.
            The sub script element is used to write something in subscript like foot notes & some chemical formulas.
            for line changing a (br) tag is used in html thast is self closing tag.for theme breaking (hr) tag is used
            and it creates a horizontal line.

    <img src="asset/sem.jpg" width="500px" height="300px">
    <p><i>Semantic markup includes strong element that is used to show the content has strong importance.
            For example, the words contained in this element might be said with strong emphasis. It also includes
            emphasis element that shows the content in italic.
            There are two elements used for marking up quotations such as q and block quote.
            The q element gives the text quotation marks & the blockquote is used to give link of the website & it only
            shows to the developer no in browser. We also use the abbr element for abbreviations.
            Also there ia an address element that is used to add the contact details of the author.
            We have ins or del element to add or delete something.The s element is used to show that something is no
            longer accurate.</i></p>
